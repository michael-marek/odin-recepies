        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Pierogi are a type of dumpling from Poland.
             They are made by wrapping unleavened dough (dough without yeast) around a 
             savoury or sweet filling and cooking in boiling water and are often then pan-fried before serving.
             Pierogi are usually filled with either potato, quark, sauerkraut, ground meat, mushrooms, or fruit

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500g wheat flour</li>
            <li>1/2tsp salt</li>
            <li>50ml oil</li>
            <li>250ml hot water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add all dough ingredients to a large bowl</li>
            <li>Combine then knead the ingredients together until the dough is soft and elastic</li>
            <li>Gently shape the dough into a ball and put it back in the bowl. </li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with a rag</li>
            <li>Let rest for 30 minutes. (This will prevent the dough from shrinking when rolled out)</li>
            <li>Once rested, divide the dough into 3 parts</li>
            <li>Take 1 part and roll it out</li>
            <li>Use a glass rim to cut circles out of the dough</li>
            <li>Put 1tsp of your filling of choice into each circle</li>
            <li>Wrap the dough around the filling and use your index finger and thumb or a fork to stamp the 
                edge, closing the pierog</li>
        </ol>
